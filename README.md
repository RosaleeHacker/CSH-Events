# CSH-Events
An events calendar for CSHers to plan and organize non-house related events

I was inspired to make this because CSH is a very social organization. There are so many groups that are always going to hockey
games, concerts, and various on and off campus events but the planning is always last minute. This is an events calendar for 
everyone to post so that events are aware and easy to plan. The front end for my website is written in HTML/CSS, Javascript with
a few elements using Bootstrap. The actual calendar portion is written in PHP with a MYSQL database. I hope to continue editing
this over the years, integrating it with rides and syncing it with iCal.
